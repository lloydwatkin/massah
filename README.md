# Thanks

Thanks to [Browserstack](http://www.browserstack.com) for a FREE basic account in order to test __Massah__.

# Introduction

__Massah__ is essentially a wrapper around the following projects just making things a few steps easier for developers to run up a BDD-style automated browser testing setup.

- [Yadda](https://github.com/acuminous/yadda)
- [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/)
- [Should](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js/)
- [selenium-webdriver](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/)
- [webdriverjs-helper](https://github.com/surevine/webdriverjs-helper)

# Build status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lloydwatkin/massah.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/lloydwatkin/massah)

# How to use

## Install

```
npm i --save-dev massah
```

To access cli tools you can install __Massah__ globally, or access them in ```./node_modules/.bin/massah*```.

## Getting started

```bash
massah init
```

This command initializes your project creating the following folder structure (if not present):

- test
  - features
  - steps
  - screenshots
  
__Features__ are where you write your BDD tests in plain text, __steps__ is where you  define these steps in code, and __screenshots__ are used to store screenshots of any failed test steps.

Additionally an empty helper file is installed at ```test/helper.js``` this is not necessary but can be used later.
  
## Running tests
  
```
massah test
```

You can set this to be used for `npm test` in your **package.json**.

### Browsers

__Massah__ is set up to use multiple browsers. By default __Firefox__ is used. Browsers available to use are:

- Firefox (__firefox__)
- Phantomjs (__phantomjs__) **requires install of phantomjs**
- Opera (__opera__)
- Safari (__safari__)
- IE (__ie__)
- Chrome
  - Remotely (__chrome__)
  - Using [chromedriver](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver) (__chromedriver__)

To switch browser simply set an environment variable of __BROWSER__ set to one of the bold values above. For example,

```bash
BROWSER=chromedriver massah test
```

Options:

- ```--headless```: Run tests headlessly

### Configuration file

Placing a file ```.massah.js``` in the root of your project will cause __Massah__ to read this file for configuration values. The configuration file should return a function which is passed a copy of arguments (as processed by `yargs`), this in turn should return a JSON object of values. It is up to the user to define how values are set.

Standard values:

- **timeout**: Timeout for test steps in milliseconds, defaults to __60000__
- **runner**: Which runner would like to use (e.g. **vanilla**, **browserstack**) uses __vanilla__ by default
- **headless**: Whether to run tests headlessly or not (not supported by all runners), defaults to false __false__
- **applicationPort**: Tells __Massah__ which port your application is running on where appropriate. Defaults to __3000__
- **seleniumServerPort**: Which port to use for the selenium server. Defaults to __4444__
- **capabilities**: Object containing browser/os details see below

See the [example file](https://github.com/lloydwatkin/massah/blob/master/.massah.js) for more information.

#### Capabilities

**capabilties** is a key within the configuration object with its own sets of properties. Essentially it describes the browser and environment that you wish to run your tests in. Some keys can be specific to the platform they are running on (e.g. [browserstack](http://www.browserstack.com)):

- **browser**: Browser to use for tests, defaults to __firefox__
- **os**: Operating system. No default
- **os_version**: Operating system version. No default
- **browser_version**: Browser version. No default
- **screen_resolution**: Screen resolution. No default

### Browserstack

__Massah__ can now run tests via [browserstack](http://www.browserstack.com) meaning that you can run your automated UI tests again several browsers on several different operating systems.

To achieve this set __runner__ equal to **browserstack** and set values for your username and key. An example of how to do this is in the `.massah.js` file.

__Note:__ If running parallel tests running more than the permitted parallel test runs on your browserstack account will result in tests failing.

## Getting help

```
massah help
```

# Tests

## Writing features
 
For an example of a feature file please see: [test/features/add-option.feature](https://github.com/lloydwatkin/massah/blob/master/test/features/add-option.feature)

After this please read the [Yadda guide](https://github.com/acuminous/yadda#step-2---write-your-first-scenario)

## Writing steps

For an example of a step definition file please see: [test/steps/url.js](https://github.com/lloydwatkin/massah/blob/master/test/steps/url.js)

After this please read the [Yadda guide](https://github.com/acuminous/yadda#step-3---implement-the-step-library)
 
All step files are loaded at once before the test suite starts meaning that defined steps can be shared.

An example step file would appear as follows:

```javascript
var massah = require('massah/helper')

module.exports = (function() {
    var library = massah.getLibrary()
        .given('I visit http://google.co.uk', function() {
            this.driver.get('http://google.co.uk)
        })
        .when('I search for \'(.*)\'', function(searchTerm) {
            this.params.searchTerm = searchTerm
            this.driver.input('input[name=q]').enter(searchTerm)
        })
        .then('I expect to see the results page', function() {
            var params = this.params
            this.driver.currentUrl(function(currentUrl) {
                currentUrl.should.include(params.searchTerm)
            })
        })
    
    return library
})()
```

Also see the helper functions in [webdriverjs-helper](https://github.com/surevine/webdriverjs-helper) for some extra usefulness.

## Sharing data between tests

As you can see from the example above data can be shared between test steps using the `params` object.  This object is cleaned with each new test scenario, but can be used for sharing data in between tests.

## Starting / Stopping / Accessing your application from Massah

Sometimes it makes sense to contain your application within __Massah__, e.g. to provide canned responses to API calls or to serve files to the browser.

In order to do this create a `helper.js` file in the __test__ folder of your application. This test helper will then be provided to each test as part of the __context__ object. From step definition files this is available at ```this.application.helper```. You may export as many or as few helper functions as you require.

### Starting your application

If your helper exports a ```beforeSuite``` or ```beforeFeature``` method then these will be called and passed a callback parameter. The callback should be called when your application has completed starting up.

If using Browserstack then you will need to start your application before your tests run (i.e. in ```beforeSuite```). This is because their browserstack local process requires a listener to be available on your application port whilst running.

### Stopping your application

If your helper exports a ```afterSuite``` or ```afterFeature``` method then these will be called and passed a callback parameter. The callback should be called when your application has completed closing down.

### Accessing your application

If your helper exports a ```beforeScenario``` method then this will be called at the beginning of a scenario. This allows you 
to set up spies/mocks/etc as required for each test.

The first argument to this method is the __annotations__ object 
which contains any annotations added to the feature or scenario. The second argument is the __context__ object allowing you to set 
data which will be available to each of the test steps. The context object exists as follows: 

```javascript
{
    driver: /* browser */
    params: {}  /* Location to store shared data */
    application: /* The exports from your application test helper */
}
```

For an example of annotations being used please see the annotation override test in __Massah__.

### @Only / @Pending / grepping tests

You can run only a certain scenario or feature by adding the __@Only__ annotation.

Tests can be skipped by adding the __@Pending__ annotation.

You can grep (or inverse grep for tests using your ```.massah.js``` file), see [this example](https://github.com/lloydwatkin/massah/blob/master/.massah.js#L16-L19).
# Testing

To test __Massah__, simply run

```
npm test
```

From the command line. __Massah__ uses itself to test itself. Please also check out our build job on [Travisci](https://travis-ci.org) where we use [Browserstack](http://www.browserstack.com) to test multiple browsers in parallel: https://travis-ci.org/lloydwatkin/massah/builds

# Name

The name __Massah__ comes from the fantasy fiction novel called 'The Torah' and its cumulative sequel 'The Bible'. During the chapter titled 'Exodus' the Israelite people are being led out of Egypt. At one point they begin to worry about their lack of water/supplies/etc. Their leader, a character named Moses, gets a little miffed at them for daring to question the wisdom of the "sky man" for sending them on the journey.  This place was then named __Massah__ which basically means **to test**.
